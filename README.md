# TheRedPlanetMars (In Progress)
View images of Mars.

This is a basic android app for practicing the MVP structure and jUnit/Espresso testing in Android. It is currently in progress.

 - Connects to NASA JSON API to retrieve images from the Mars rovers (Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity).
 - Uses GSON, Retrofit, RxJava.
 - Able to select date of the pictures.
 - Uses material design and fluid animations. 
 - Espresso/Junit tests. 
 
Need to implement:
 - Details Screen (completed)
 - Adapt to tablets and landscape orientation
 - Add a date picker to select date (completed)
 - Improve drawerlayout
 - Junit/Espresso Tests
